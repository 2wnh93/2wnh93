### Hi there, I'm Zawanah ðŸ‘‹


I'm formerly an auditor and have since pursued a budding interest in the value and wonders of Data and Machine Learning. I am currently a Data Science Immersive Course Student at General Assembly (GA) and enjoy practising and applying knowledge I've learnt through projects and collborating with my teammates. Python is my first language and I enjoy writing in Markdown! 

#### ðŸŒ± Skills learnt

- Statistics
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualisations
- Regression Models (Linear Regression, Multivariate Regression)
- Classification Models (Logstic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector) 
- Feature Engineering
- Webscraping (JSON API, Reddit API)
- Natural Language Processing

#### :paw_prints: Recent projects

- Reddit API and Classification
- Predicting House Prices (Ames) 
- SAT vs ACT Analysis

#### âš¡ Fun facts

- I have at least 2 cups/thermos with me when I work as coffee keeps my brain alert while tea prevents my brain from going on overdrive. I always have plain water with me as coffee is dehydrating and tea is a diuretic. 
- When I'm not coding, I am watching Netflix :tv:, reading :books:, playing Pokemon TCGO :computer:, playing chess or I'm out and about (I love nature walks :herb: and hikes etc)
